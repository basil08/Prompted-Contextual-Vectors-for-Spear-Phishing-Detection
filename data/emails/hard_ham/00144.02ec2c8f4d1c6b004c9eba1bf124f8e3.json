{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Digital Media]  Clever Ritual", "email_body": "Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is now available in all six formats, for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content based on a couple reader suggestions."}
