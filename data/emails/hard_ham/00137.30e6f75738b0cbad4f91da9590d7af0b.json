{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Webmaster Weekly]  Educational Capabilities", "email_body": "This year's SIC gets the blame for the lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.\n\nOne cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, is Nick Bradbury's release of TopStyle 3.0. Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that previously defined TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of the next two issues.\n\nAlso in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the Training From the Source book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for both static pages, in the form of Dreamweaver tips, and tips on dynamic site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.\n\nJake Ludington"}
