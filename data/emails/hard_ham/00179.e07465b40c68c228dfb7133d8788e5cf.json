{"email_subject": "United We Fall?", "email_body": "US Airways scored a $500 million bankruptcy court bailout. American Airlines announced a re-org. United Airlines' parent company's stock sank on speculation that UAL is next in line for Chapter 11. It's a wonder none of this happened last September, but it's not much consolation to airline employees, shareholders, and customers that it's happening now.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal had the most extensive coverage of American's plan as of Unspun's deadline. The airline will lay off 7,000 workers, ground some jets, cut back on flight amenities such as food, and retool its hub operations to make for longer layovers. \"In the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,\" said the Journal. \"Now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time.\" In this age of penny-pinching, American's worried about low-cost carriers, not the big guys like, um, US Air and United. \n\nSpeaking of United, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. Let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. The $3.80 share price may be the least of UAL's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. \"The ATSB expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect U.S. taxpayers' interests,\" said the L.A. Times. Sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of United's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. Workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000-member machinists' union. Analysts moaned in anti-labor frustration. \n\nThe basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and non-U.S. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy. \"The U.S. government has bailed out carriers with insurance subsidies and federal loan guarantees\" while \"European authorities have acted more wisely,\" letting Swissair and Sabena \"go to the wall,\" said the Financial Times. Canadian pundits agreed that America should let a couple of airlines wilt, since the Canadian airline industry benefited from the demise of Canadian Airlines and Canada 3000.
