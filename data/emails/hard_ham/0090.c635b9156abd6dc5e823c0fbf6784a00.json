{"email_subject": "This Week: Chilkat Zip, Anfy Java, VB-PowerWrap", "email_body": "Greetings from Download.com!\n\nNo software developer is immune to bugs. Even the cleanest code\nwill have to go through a debugging process, but some debuggers\nare more efficient than others. Check out Download.com's\ncomplete collection of debugging tools here, and put away the\ncan of Raid.\n\nAlso this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,\nthere's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can\nadd to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major\nones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool\nthat takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic\nmasterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file\nfor ease of distribution.\n\nBecky Waring\nContributing Editor, CNET Download.com"}
