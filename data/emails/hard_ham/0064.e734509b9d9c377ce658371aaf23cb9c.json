{"email_subject": "Four free e-mailers reviewed, Get the gear you need to burn DVDs", "email_body": "If the best things in life are free, why does software cost so much? Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for free. Now, even Yahoo is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client. But if you look closely enough, you can still find some worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed four free e-mailers to get you started. And we've also taken a peek at the new BearShare, which is not only free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is another matter entirely."}
