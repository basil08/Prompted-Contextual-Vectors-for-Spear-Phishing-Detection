{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Webmaster Weekly]  Compatible Whistles", "email_body": "Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all you Dreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) easier to use. I've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX suite, but I've been able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to check 'em out too.\n\nAs I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently switched cell phones to the Kyocera QCP6035. The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like driving directions.\n\nNow that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to be at least a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles."}
