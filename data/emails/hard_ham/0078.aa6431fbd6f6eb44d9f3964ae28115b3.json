{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Apple Core]  Intuitive Cash", "email_body": "Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get up to speed.\n\nI'm off to the Shareware Industry Conference for the remainder of the week, where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this evening just to be sure.\n\nWith some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as usual.\n\nSee You in August,\nJake Ludington"}
