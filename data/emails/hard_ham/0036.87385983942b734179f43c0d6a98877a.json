{"email_subject": "CNET DIGITAL DISPATCH: Saying good-bye to free", "email_body": "It was a crushing blow to discover that Vindigo, my all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.\n\nThat's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on.

Read our reviews of the four top services to see what you get if you dish out the dough (or not)--and which to avoid if you want to stay spam-free.\n\nSurfacing on this week's Buzz Meter is another free-gone-fee app. The latest version of the popular file-sharing software BearShare now offers a paid version that lets you search and download without those annoying ads. Maybe the best things in life are now those with a fee."}
