{"email_subject": "MiniNTK 2002-08-16", "email_body": "There comes a time in every August when news services should just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the window until dawn.\n\nYeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.\n\nOr, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the \"Hyperactive\" chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn about \"using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked effects\", \"techniques for making little speakers sound huge\" and - perhaps most distressingly - \"picking the right instrument and register for best audibility\". The cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of music lovers worldwide.\n\nhttp://www.headspace.com/seminar2002.htm\n- So they're better than monophonic ringtones. What isn't?"}
