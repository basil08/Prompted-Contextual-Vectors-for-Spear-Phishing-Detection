{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Tech Specialist]  Handprint Singing", "email_body": "Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience: \n\n\"You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you \nmight want to point out to other Gnomies that they could \npractice their Karaoke on my Red Hot \nKaraoke Page site. There are the words and music for \nmore than 1100 songs available on the site and by \ndownloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they \ncan even change the key of the song to suit their voice \nrange as well as speed up or slow down the music to their \ntaste. In other words, to have the same experience as they \nwould have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no \nextra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to \nGnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly \nprepared for your Karaoke.\"\n\nTravel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to \nhelp out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server \nand networking stuff. The tough part is remembering \neverything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, \nalways, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks \nin advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a \nhandprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that \nI left something important behind. What will it be this \ntime, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday."}
