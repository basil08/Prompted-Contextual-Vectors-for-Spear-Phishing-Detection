If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake.\" Gwyneth, previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck, admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she accepted with pleasure. One of her \"very charming\" dates was actor James Purefoy, who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.\n\nA one-on-one interview\nMuscle-bound Vin Diesel, star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters.
