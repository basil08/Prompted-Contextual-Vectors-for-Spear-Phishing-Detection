{"email_subject": "This Week: FileSystem, AppletFile, PHP Master Editor", "email_body": "Greetings from Download.com!\n\nIf you're developing Windows applications in an ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls, and edit hex code to get you up and running.\n\nAlso this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries: FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds serial number and shareware-type functionality to your applications.\n\nBecky Waring\nContributing Editor, CNET Download.com"}
