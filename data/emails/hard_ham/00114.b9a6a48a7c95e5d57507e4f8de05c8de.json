{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Tech Specialist]  Friend Fry", "email_body": "I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I fry?\n\nAs it turns out, it was another case of \"always check the small stuff\". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message like every other computer on the planet, I can only attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How appropriate..."}
