A few months ago I \nran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic \nwith him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, \nso I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he \nthought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there \nsometime through the afternoon.\nWendy Downs\n\n\n------------------------ Yahoo!
