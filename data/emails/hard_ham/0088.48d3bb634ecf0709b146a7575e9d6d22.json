{"email_subject": "CNET: Copycat worms and a PGP Outlook flaw", "email_body": "So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier\nworms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,\nthese new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.\nBut if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the\ncontinuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security\nnews, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect\nOutlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.\n\nFrethem.k worm wants to give you a password\nAn e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with\na password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm\nfamily. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also\ncalled Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to\nsend e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This\nworm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users\nare not affected.\n\nYaha.e screensaver worm spreading\nThe Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly\nscreensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening\nattached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also\nknown as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of\na worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,\nthis worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.\n\nLeaky PGP Outlook plug-in\nPGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook\ne-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail\nprogram open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available."}
