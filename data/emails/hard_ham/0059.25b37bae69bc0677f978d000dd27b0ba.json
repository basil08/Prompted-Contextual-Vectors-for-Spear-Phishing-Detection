{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Digital Media]  Humblest Alarm", "email_body": "To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. \nI mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing \nquite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double \nalbum this year and have been touring in support of that release. \nFor today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC \nbreakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).\n\nI know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is \nawesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm \nsure it would be better on a color screen, like the \nTreo 270, but for what I'll need, \nthis works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that \nremote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's \nuse of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. \n\nI'm also scoping out the \nPalm Markup Language \n(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, \nin an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of \nthe files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content \norganized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add \nsome minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and \nanyone else who reads them on their Palm."}
