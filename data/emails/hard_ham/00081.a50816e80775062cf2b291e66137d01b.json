{"email_subject": "Personal laser picks for students, SOHO users, and more! (ZDNET SHOPPER)", "email_body": "Dear Reader,\n\nPersonal lasers come in shapes, sizes, and prices to suit almost any user. A low-end desktop laser printer can cost as little as $199 or as much as $500, but most hover around $300 and strike a good balance between speed, quality, and features. The less expensive models will suit students or home users who need to print letters or homework assignments, as well as perform other simple tasks.
