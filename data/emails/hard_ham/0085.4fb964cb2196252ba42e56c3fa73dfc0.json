The town of Brooklyn, Iowa has a bridge that they are selling on Ebay, so if you have a need for such a structure, or just want to have the right to say you legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!\n\nEver since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field back in my Marine Corps days. \n\nAs time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of minutes. See what you've started, Jake?\n\nSee You in August,\nRandy Nieland"}
