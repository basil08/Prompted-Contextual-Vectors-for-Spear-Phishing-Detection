{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Apple Core]  Skip Content", "email_body": "I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 Mac OS X Tips is in publication and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.\n\nAlthough this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the \"Review by\" links at the bottom of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris and Randy.\n\nI've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. Either way, I'm open to some AppleScript suggestions.\n\nSee You in August,\nJake Ludington"}
