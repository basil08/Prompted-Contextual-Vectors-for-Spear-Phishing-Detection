{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Tech Specialist]  Frequent Format", "email_body": "Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, \nI haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when \nHal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery \nmethod that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a \nspin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the <a \nhref=\"http://www.pocketpcmag.com/digital/default.asp\">Digital \nEdition</a> and see if you like reading the mag in that \nformat better than the print variety. A Software and \nAccessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my \nlast belated visit.\n\nI've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but \nnot for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as \nan MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. \nGoing out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and \nit's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the \nCompaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more \npleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to \nthe sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass \nlevels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my \nopinion. \n\nSee You in August,\nRandy Nieland"}
