{"email_subject": "This week: Rhapsody rules", "email_body": "I never thought I\u2019d say it, but I\u2019m changing my tune about subscription music services.\n\nWhen MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com\u2019s Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I\u2019m rethinking my stance.\n\nRhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you\u2019ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can\u2019t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s?
