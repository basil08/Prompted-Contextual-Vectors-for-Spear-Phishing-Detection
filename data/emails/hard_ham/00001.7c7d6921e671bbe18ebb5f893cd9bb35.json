I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. \nI ALREADY HAVE \nA CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW \nCAN I STOP IT? \n\nA. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and \nthey've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to \nbe removed from junk mail (er, \"direct mail\") lists and \ntelemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. \n\nFull Answer:\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562069\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nYOUR MONEY \n\nRESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP\nLet's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that \nhang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore \neverywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions \nbecause they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. \nLive every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. \nNo pressure. Right? Wrong. \nhttp://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070\n\nDon't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list \nthat is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks \nnow and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution \nyou can get behind. Let's get started! \n\n1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT \nIt's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with \none phone call.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 \n\n2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS\nDon't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. \nEarn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. \nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072\n\n3. INVEST FOR LESS \nMake sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates \nand hire a new one in only 60 seconds. \nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073\n\n4. RETIRE EARLY\nThanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more \nto your retirement accounts.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074\n\n5. REFINANCE AND SAVE \nWhen interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity \nto save big money.\nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075\n\nIf this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it \nalone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your \nfinances with TMF Money Advisor.

But over the short term, \nthe market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is \nreally speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have \nyour emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's \ntuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you \ncan't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your \nsavings, keep it out of the market.\n\nOf course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure \nout the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our \nnifty Savings Center. \nhttp://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562078\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nCOMMUNITY TIPS\n\nDO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY\nFolks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been \nsharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in \n2002 to save money. \n\n-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse \n so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of \n stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my \n coupons at home. \n\n-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I \n have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, \n like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is \n $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 \n bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. \n\n-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't \n get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be \n a great time to do this. \n\n-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find \n a cheaper long-distance plan.\n\n-Document everything that I give to charity, including the \n clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. \n\n-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the \n house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). \n\nHave any tips of your own?
