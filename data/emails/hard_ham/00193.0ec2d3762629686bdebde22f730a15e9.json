{"email_subject": "[Lockergnome Tech Specialist]  Transportation Rage", "email_body": "When I was in Omaha a couple of weeks ago, I made the unfortunate mistake of driving through the intersection of 90th and Dodge. Those of you in Omaha know what sorts of things I was muttering under my breath during the ordeal. Is it possible to suffer from road rage when you're not moving? Omaha has started a 10 year project on Dodge street, which more or less divides the city in half east to west. The traffic tie-ups due to the construction disaster at 90th and Dodge are being felt by nearby businesses. A bank is fighting back in a creative way, replacing random $20 and $10 bills in their ATM machine with $50 and $20 notes respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. And I just drove right by the place.\n\nThe route to Des Moines from Waterloo isn't much better right now as they widen highway 330/65 to 4 lane between Marshalltown and Des Moines. Once that's done, it will cut 20-30 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress they've been making, it won't be too much longer. That's probably the fastest moving highway construction I've seen during my travels throughout Iowa over the years. As you travel to Gnomedex from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on construction at this handy site put up by the Iowa Department of Transportation.\n\nSee You in Des Moines,\nRandy Nieland"}
