{"email_subject": "Need a PDA that's more than a phonebook? (ZDNET SHOPPER)", "email_body": "Basic electronic organizers they're not, but if you're searching for a pocket-sized computer for music, movies, and games, then these PDAs are well worth a look. All four models feature fast processors, large amounts of RAM, and sharp, color screens, which make them better choices for rich media than competing products. But beyond those basics, these handhelds are very different. You'll find three different operating systems: Pocket PC, Palm, and Linux. Two have keyboards, one has a built-in Bluetooth radio, and all four support various expansion card formats. Most Pocket PCs are multimedia friendly; we've picked two that really stand out because of features or price. However, none of these are inexpensive models, so check out our hands-on reviews to find the high-end handheld that you'll be happiest with."}
