{"email_subject": "Hi! I'm new here.", "email_body": "I just found out that using dry milk can save half of the money buying liquid milk, also save spaces in the frig. I recently bought an extended warranty through the internet instead of dealer, which saved me over $1000. I like your group, there are great suggestions. I'm thinking to work at home using my computer, but didn't find anything yet. Anybody has updates?It is more important to me to make a little than save a little. Thank you all!"}
